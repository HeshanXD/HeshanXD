      <p>Dear Poorani,

        Wishing you a very happy 18th birthday! It's been great getting to know you and becoming your friend. You have a wonderful personality that I really admire, and I feel like we think alike in many ways. I hope your birthday is filled with joy, laughter, and all your favorite things. May this year bring you many new experiences and opportunities to grow. Cheers to another year of making great memories together!
        
        Best wishes,
        </p>
